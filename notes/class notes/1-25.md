# Scaling (cont.)

## Verticle and Horozontal Scaling
Assume we are starting with a light load and handle all requests on one machine when suddenly demand increases  

Easiest approach to scaling is to just buy a faster machine to run the service on

* Only gets someone so far

Vast majoity of scaled services use horizontal scaling, which is adding more computers that work on the same problem


## Verticle Scaling pros v. cons

Pros

* Easy to write programs
* Most languages have support for multithreading
* Most "off the shelf" software is written to run on one machine
* Modern servers can do a lot of work in parallel with ~96 cores
* Can connect hundeds of disks to a machine before overwhelming I/O bandwidth
* Avoids slow communication with outside machines

Cons

* Cannot handle really huge loads
* Cannot be scaled quickly in fine-grained manner
  * Must replace entire machine instead of adding one more node
* Single point of failure
* Price/performance ration is poor for top of the line machines
  * Motherboards with many sockets are expensive
  * Fastest CPUs are expensive

Ultimately: Verticle scaling is not scalable

## Horozontal Scaling

Horozontal scaling is needed for global applications

* Public cloud computing providers can give you lots of machines, but making good use of them is very difficult

This class is going to address the coordination of execution and data in horozontally scaled systems

## What effects a computers performance

Primary

* Number of CPU cores
* Speed of each CPU core
* (Lack of) competing processes running on the same machine
* Amount of memory (RAM)

Secondary

* Type of disk (SSD v. Magnetic)
* Number of disks (parallel access)
* Type of network connectivity
* Presence of GPU's TPU's and other special-purpose accelerators

## Parallelism within a machine

At any given time there are usually 100 processes running on a laptop  
The OS kernel schedules processes so they take turns using a CPU  
Processes will block (wait) while doing I/O

* For example reading file from disks or waiting for a message to arrive over a network

While a process is blocked another process can take over the CPU  
A single process can have multiple threads which execute concurrently while sharing the same memory (*Shared Memory Parallelism*)

## Scalability inside microservice instances

We've been acting as if each microservice is a set of processes, but ignoring how those processes were built  
Many will use parallel programming of some form because modern computers have NUMA architectures

## Best way to leverage parallelism

Not every way of scaling is equally effective!

Options

1. Keep server busy by running one multithreaded app on it
1. Keep it busy by running 

Suprisingly, multi-threading is one of the worst solutions to scaling

* NUMA architecture restrictions

## NUMA Architecture

A NUMA computer is a really small rack of computers on a chip that share lots of resources and local memory

* Each has its own L2 cache and small groups may share DRAM

With 12 cores, you may have 4 dram modules serving 2 cores each

* Assuming nearby DRAm is rapid
  * Accessing the other DRAM modules is ~15x slower

NUMA hardware provides cache consistencey nad locking, but costs can be high if the features have lots of work to do  
We therefore probably could build fast multithreaded code, but putting our servers in single-threaded apps within container VMs is way easier

## Which model WINS

Best is container virtualization with one process for each distinct user. This elimanates lock contention and memory sharing, allowing the NUMA code to run faster
 
* Much easier to develop code for

One NUMA server may host hundreds of these containers

The "best" code is faster that similar code that "fights" the hardware

## Cloud computing makes scaling easier

Verticle Scaling: Change instance type of VM

* Upgrade by tier or select new image entirely
* Only requires reboot of VM

Horozontal Scaling: Purchase more VM instances

* New instance will be ready to use in few minutes

We call cloud computing resources elastic because you can quickly scale in either direction

## Multi-day recap
A software **service** is a program that runs continuouslyl giving responses to requests  
A **platform** is a software that abstracts details and provides mechanisms for building software  
**Scalability** is the ability of a service to grow to handle many concurrent users  
2 scaling approaches

* **Vertical**: Upgrading machine's power
* **Horozontal**: Adding more concurrent machines
