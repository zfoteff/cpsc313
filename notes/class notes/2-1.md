# How to implement Connected Services

## Last time: types of services

A software service is a program that runs continuously giving responses to requests

**Scalability** is the ability of a service to grow to handle many concurrent users (arbitrarily large)

Two general approaches to scaling

1. Vertical scaling: upgrading machines
1. Horizontal scaling: adding more machines

## How are services different than program

A computer program takes a symbolic input and returns a symbolic output, then is stops  
A computer service recieves requests and returns a response for each request. It often doesn't stop and recieves requests continually

* Services can handle many concurrent, independant requests, which may be from different users
* Services tend to be more like functions than programs
  * Microservice does one thing
  * Remote service is like RPC (Remote Proceedure Call) functions, like a remote function call
    * This is NOT a client server pattern. Parameter arguments are marshalled into a data packet which is passed to a service
    * Mostly obsolete

## Program -> Service

A program can be translated into a service by:

* Listening to requests that arrive from a network
* Running many copies of the program concurrently using threads or processes

This will work well so long as there are CPU threads available to use

What happens if there are no listeners?

* Apache and Nginx scale by adding threads to handle HTTP requests
  * Neither has a real message queue and rely on connections (TCP)
* Either server will drop connections when they get too many to handle

### Adding a message queue

Now messages are not sent directly to the web service, they are pushed into a message/event queue  

* Each microservice takes the message and processes it, then moves onto the next ready message
* Can also have a queue for unsent responses from the service

## Service thread

Common module: RabbitMQ

The program on each thread runs an infinite loop

```python3
while (true):
    req = reqQueue.pop()
    res = doWork(res)
    resQueue.push(res)
```

* Pop waits if the queue is empty
* Push might wait if queue is too full

## Concurrency

Many requests can be handled at the same time (concurrently). This allows many CPU cores to be used in parallel  
Threaded design is helpful even if there is only a single CPU core

## Web frameworks

Web/HHTP server software provides basic framework
