# E2E Microservices

## Microservice pools

### Every microservice is a parallel pool

* Every one of those little nodes is itself a small elastic pool of processes
* Microservices are desined so that data-centers can run one/many instances 'elastically' to deal with dynamically varying demand
  * Idea is that every instance can handle any request equally well so there is no need for careful routing of specific requests to specific instances

Key idea: Any instance should be able to handle any request equally as well

* Keep it generic so it can handle any request

## Advantages of microservices

1. Modular -> Easy to understand
1. Speed of development and deployment
1. On demand provisioning/elasticity
1. Resuability
1. Language/frameword heterogenity

## Performance Management

Dependancies cause Quality of Service solution

## Adding instances

Threading and core changes are different instances of a program  
Sometimes two identical copies of a program are running on different computers

* Will use load balancer to send requests to least loaded instances 

## Service Scalability

**Service Scalability**: A service is scalable if it can easily handle the number of concurrent users/requests in a given amount of a time

## Elastic Scalability

**Elastic Scalability**: Pools of services add of remove instances dynamically based on the demand required of it

Designed to grow and shrink on demand

Load swings are inevitable using this model

## Difficulties of scaling

1. Limited of capabilities of physical machine
1. Coordinating multiple machines is difficult
1. Sharing data among multiple machines is difficult when competing requests attempt to modify the same data
1. More machines means a higher probability that one will fail
1. Users can be distibuted worldwide, increasing communication latency
1. Service components must trust each other, but ignore interferance from attackers
1. Software updates must be deployed w/out downtime

## Verticle and Horozontal Scaling

Two major ways to scale software infrastructure

**Verticle Scaling**: makes machines bigger/faster/stronger

**Horozontal Scaling**: adds more machines running towards the same services
