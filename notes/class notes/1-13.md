# Scaling Software

## Gap in typical CS curriculum

Most students learn about single threaded, single machine program writing

* Tends to focus on theory, history, principles

This results in most CS graduates are not ready to be productive in software dev environments

* Most are ready to learn how to be productive once they leave

Backend: 80% - Frontend: 20%

* Most computationally complex problems exist in the backend

## What we will learn in the class 

We will learn about real, complex, big software services

* Writing correct and efficeint code is a small part of the challenge

### Topics

* Seperations of concerns: Microservices, API
* Asynchronicity

## Scale

Speed at scale determines revenue, and revenue shapes technology

* Arms race to speed up the cloud

Amazon led the trend in reinventing data center computing

Requests arrive at first tier of of very lightweight servers  
These requests dispatch work requests on a message bus or queue  
Requests are selected by micro-services running in elastic pools  
One web request might involve tens or hundreds of micro-services  

## Platform

**Platform**: Software upon which other software is build and run

* Abstract underlying complexity and details
* Lets programmers focus on their requirements
* May or may not completely obscure the underlying hardware/systems

Obvious example: Operating System

* Abstract the management of the hardware & firmware, scheduling, resource usage, security, basic scale
* You don't have to use an operating system - it is a massive pain in the ass though

Next most obvious: Data store

* Abstact the storage, management, manipulation, retrieval

### Platform components

Three main layers or components within a platform

1. Physical or Implementation: Implementation on the platform
1. Logical: Define the concepts, abstractions, relationships and capabilities
1. Interface: Defines API's or UI's to allow the users to interface with the systems

## Traditional view of software scalability

As input data size n gets bigger, program should run quickly

* Complexity analysis lists program runtime as a function of input size

## Services V. Programs

A service is different than a simple program because it listens for requests from clients/users and may handle multiple requests concurrently  
User calls service with a request, and service responds with an output

### Micro services

A small service; does one, usually simple, task

* Ex: Login service: Service is called with user/password or token -> returns token or approval

Scaling microservices is far easier than scaling traditional services
