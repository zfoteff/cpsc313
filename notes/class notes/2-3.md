# Networking wrap up

ip addr

000.000.000.000

url: protocol://ip_addr:port/path/query
ex:  http://127.0.0.1:80/path/?username=value&key=value

first 2 sections: router (network) address  
second 2 sections: host address  

Answering most common interview question

1. how to calculate request
1. how does the request get there
1. how does the server respond

```bash
arp -a -v 
```

Displays ip - mac addr mapping table

```bash
tracert <addr>
```

Traces the route to a network host, or ip address

TCP: Establishes connection first, can be dropped if not picked up
UDP: Connectionless. Comparable to chat, doesnt need user to acknowledge the delivered message

When you want a microservice to be able to communicate over a network, you send it over https using UDP or TCP

If you care about each individual packets, then use TCP

* This will be email or other text based things

If you care about speed as opposed to fidelity, then you use UDP

* Video players don't care if a packet is missing every once in a while. It may also have mechanisms to fill gaps in the packets

# New coding concept

We will be making a messaging system. There is an application protocol for messaging called AMQP

* This is a queue protocol for communicating with queues
