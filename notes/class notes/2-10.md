# Stateless vs Statefull services

## Wikipedia architecture

Main app is MediaWiki

* 70% PHP 30% JavaScript
* Databases are MariaDB (SQL)

## Caching

## On-demand cache

Cache is filled with items as the user demands it

* if it has it -> send it
* if it doesnt have it -> retrieve from server, send to client, cache sent item

Issues

* What to do if the cache is full

### Write through cache

Writes through cache to the db storage

### Write back cache

Data is only updated in cache and is then written back later to the database

## Proxies

Browsers send we requests to a proxy, which then forwards it on to an actual web server

* Computers / routers can expose other ports on the system and run applications that can moniter the http traffic

## Wikipedia arhictecture overview

**Squid**: Front-end HTTP proxy cache

* Stores static data for website
  * Images
  * Text

**Apache httpd**: Web servers running main (MediaWiki) application

## Stateful v. Stateless

### Stateless

Stateless code has no memory

* Similar to pure function
* Output is not effected by previous result

### Stateful

Stateful code has side effects in the memory of the computer

### If you want to scale make services stateless
