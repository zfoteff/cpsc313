Statelessness
=========

Stateless applications do not remember anything from previous requests
* Each can be handled independently based exclusively on the input request
* Can be trivially parallelized because there are no side effects for the handler


## Stateless Model

A stateless program is a normal program, but it follows one rule: no updates to persistant data on the computer where it runs
* It still has "state" in variables and so forth, but if it needs to save something it needs to be sent to some other place, like a cloud's global file system, or database

## How does statelessness help
**Load Balancers!**

DHT: Distributed hash table (kv store)

## What can we do statelessly

* Computer recommendations
* Resize images of products to fit screen properly

Soft state: Things we can easily regenerate or derive
* Doesn't matter if we lose it
Hard State
