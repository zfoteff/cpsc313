# Thoughts and comments about first assignment

## Tips about coding for scale

Readability and factoring: Intent is to be able to read code in single walkthrough  
Avoid breaking up code  

* Keep code simple by using descriptive variable names and function names
* This also applies to whitespace

Factoring

* Keep functions simple
* Generalize functions to reduce the number of functions needed
* Avoid overly small or simple functions (WHY)
* Keep user interaction to one or two functions: Rest should be passed what they need and return what they create
* Don't use main to do real computation

## Naming

Most important part of readability for dan

* Reader should never have to use code for context to understand purpose of a variable
* No shortcuts for loop control variables
* Disallowed by Dan
  * Single letter names
  * Almost all double letter names
  * Programming words (reserved language keywords)
  * General words (thing, person, data, value, etc)

## Comment

Comments are supplemental to readable code

* Most of the understanding of the code comes from reading the code itself
* Comment only when you want to explain something that really isn't obvious
  * Try to focus on comments at the beginning of the function to avoid breaking up the code
* Use docstrings where appropriate
* Comment 'how' not 'what'

## Testing

Things to test

* Test simple cases with contrived data
  * Edge casesL empty wrong values, too few params, too many, etc
  * Simple cases where you know answer
* Test more complicated cases with random data
* Sometimes you have to use multiple approaches to solve a problem, test all those approaches against each other
* Use other programmer's code to test the same problem

Comment test files to oand follow proper variable naming conventions

## Code

* Simple is always preferable to better
* Try to keep programs as close to functional programs as possible
* Always use provided libraries when possible

'Pythonic' programming

* Inline looping and conditionals
* Using library functions to do more
*
